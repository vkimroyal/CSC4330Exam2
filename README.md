# CSC 4330: Exam 2 (Revised)
By Vincent Kim
<br>CSC 4330: Programming Language Concepts
<br><br>

<i>Rules revised and analyzers redone in Python.<br>
You can run the analyzer here: https://replit.com/@VincentKim3/Test2Redo#main.py</i>

```txt
<program> --> INIT ':' <stmt> ';'
<stmt> --> <if_stmt> | <while_stmt> | <for_stmt> | <as_s> | <declaration>
<if_stmt> --> incase <bool> { <stmt> ';' }
<else_stmt> --> ifnot { <stmt> ';' }
<while_stmt> --> during <bool> { <stmt> ';' }
<for_stmt> --> for <bool> { <stmt> ';' }
<as_s> --> <vrbl> = <expression>
```

### Production Rules
```txt
E --> E + T
E --> E â€“ T
E --> T
T --> T * F
T --> T / F
F --> +F
F --> -F
F --> a
F --> (E)
```

This should conform to the standards of LL grammer and therefore have no ambiguity.
